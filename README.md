# Chest X-Ray Evaluation Tool
## This is a Python-based tool that uses a deep learning model to analyze chest X-ray images and predict the likelihood of various medical conditions. 

Features
* Multi-Label Classification: The model predicts the probability of multiple conditions (e.g., pneumonia, cardiomegaly, edema) present in a chest X-ray.
* User-Friendly GUI: Upload X-ray images directly through the interface to get real-time predictions.
* Pretrained Model: Built using a deep learning model trained on the NIH Chest X-Ray Dataset.
* Confidence Scores: Displays predictions with confidence levels for each condition.
